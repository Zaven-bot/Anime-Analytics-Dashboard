### Day 1 — Scaffolding & Setup - COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed:**
- Initialized monorepo structure with clear service boundaries
- Created repo layout: `etl/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `.github/`
- Added comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Locked in stack choices:
  - ETL: Python + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic + tenacity (retry/backoff)
  - Backend: FastAPI with PostgreSQL + Redis connecti
  - Frontend: React + Recharts for visualizations
- Created docker-compose.yml with services: postgres, redis, etl, backend, frontend
- Added docker-compose.override.yml for local development hot reload
- Set up PostgreSQL schema with `anime_snapshots` table
- Created Dockerfiles for all services
- Added requirements.txt and package.json with pinned versions
- Configured .gitignore for Python, Node, Docker, and OS files

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Monorepo approach for easier CI/CD in Week 2
- JSONB columns for flexible Jikan API data storage
- Health checks in Docker Compose for reliable startup
- Environment variable support for Week 5 secrets management

### Day 2 — ETL Design COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed:**

- Created comprehensive ETL architecture:
  - **Extractor** (`etl/extractors/jikan_extractor.py`): Async API client with retry/backoff
  - **Transformer** (`etl/transformers/anime_transformer.py`): Pydantic validation & cleaning
  - **Loader** (`etl/loaders/postgres_loader.py`): Bulk inserts with upsert capability
  - **Orchestrator** (`etl/orchestrator.py`): Configurable job management
- Implemented retry/backoff patterns:
  - Exponential backoff with tenacity library
  - Rate limiting (1 second between requests)
  - 429 handling with `Retry-After` header respect
- Added Pydantic models for type safety and validation
- Created structured logging for observability preparation
- Built test script for ETL validation


**Unit Testing Framework Created:**

- All 64 unit tests passing with structured error handling validation

### Day 3 — Integration Testing & End-to-End Verification

**Tasks Completed:**
- Built focused integration test suite in `tests/integration/` directory with clear separation of concerns
- **Connection Testing** (`a_test_connections.py`): 
  - Database connectivity verification with schema validation
  - Jikan API connectivity testing with response structure validation
  - Standalone executable for quick health checks

### Day 4 — Backend API & Redis Caching Integration

**Tasks Completed:**
- Refactored backend to use FastAPI dependency injection for Redis, following production-ready patterns (lifecycle management, no global singletons)
- Implemented Redis caching for analytics endpoints (database stats, genre distribution, top-rated anime, seasonal trends)
- Configured per-endpoint cache TTLs for optimal freshness and performance
- All cache keys and TTLs are domain-specific and documented in code
- Startup/shutdown lifecycle for Redis connection managed via FastAPI lifespan
- AnalyticsService now receives Redis client via DI, enabling easier testing and future extensibility
- Verified API endpoints return correct data and cache hits/misses are logged
- All backend endpoints (analytics, health) are working and documented in Swagger UI

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Pure dependency injection for Redis (no global state)
- Async Redis client for non-blocking cache operations
- Caching logic is encapsulated in the analytics service, but Redis client is managed at the app level

```bash
cd infrastructure/docker-compose
docker compose up -d
# Runs: postgres, redis, backend, frontend
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
```

**2. With Automated ETL Scheduling:**
```bash
cd infrastructure/docker-compose
docker compose --profile scheduler up -d
# Runs: core services + etl-scheduler (automated daily ETL at 8 AM UTC)
```

**3. With Manual ETL Capability:**
```bash
cd infrastructure/docker-compose
docker compose --profile etl up -d
# Runs: core services + etl container for manual job execution
# Execute ETL: docker compose exec etl python main.py
```

**4. Full Stack (All Services):**
```bash
cd infrastructure/docker-compose
docker compose --profile etl --profile scheduler up -d
# Runs: core services + manual ETL + automated scheduler
```

**5. Individual Service Management:**
```bash
# Start only database services
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f backend

# Execute commands in running containers
docker compose exec etl python main.py
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (full cleanup)
docker compose down -v
```

**6. Development Overrides (Optional):**
```bash
# Enable hot reload and debug mode (rename docker-compose.override.disabled.yml)
mv docker-compose.override.disabled.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker compose up -d
```
