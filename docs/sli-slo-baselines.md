- **Disk Utilization SLI**: Available disk space / Total disk space

## Current Performance Baselines (Week 3 Data)

### Backend API Metrics
```

Response Time:
  - p50: ~50ms
  - p95: ~250ms  
  - p99: ~500ms
Error Rate: <1% (mostly 4xx client errors)
Availability: >99.5% (no observed downtime)
Cache Hit Rate: 50% (first-time queries cached afterwards)
```

### ETL Pipeline Metrics
```
Job Execution Frequency: Daily scheduled runs
Success Rate: 100% (development environment)
Processing Time: 
  - Full anime sync: ~30-60 seconds
  - Records processed: ~987 anime/job (4 job types)
API Rate Limiting: 0 violations (well within Jikan limits)
Data Freshness: <24 hours (daily updates)
```

### Infrastructure Metrics
```
Database Connections: 2-5 active (low development load)
Database Query Time: <100ms average
Redis Memory Usage: <10MB
PostgreSQL Storage: <100MB
CPU Utilization: <10% average
Memory Utilization: <30% average
```

## Proposed Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Critical User-Facing SLOs (Month-over-Month)

1. **API Availability SLO**: 99.5% uptime
   - Error Budget: 3.6 hours downtime per month
   - Measurement: HTTP response codes 200-399 / Total responses

2. **API Latency SLO**: p95 < 500ms for all endpoints
   - Error Budget: 5% of requests may exceed 500ms
   - Measurement: Response time distribution from middleware logs

3. **ETL Success Rate SLO**: 95% successful job completion
   - Error Budget: 1-2 job failures per month allowed
   - Measurement: ETL job completion status from scheduler logs

### Supporting SLOs (Week-over-Week)

4. **Cache Hit Rate SLO**: >70% for improved user experience
   - Error Budget: 30% cache misses acceptable
   - Measurement: Redis cache hit/miss ratio

5. **Database Response Time SLO**: p95 < 200ms
   - Error Budget: 5% of queries may exceed 200ms
   - Measurement: Database query execution time

6. **Data Freshness SLO**: <25 hours since last update
   - Error Budget: 1 hour buffer beyond daily schedule
   - Measurement: ETL job timestamp tracking

## Alerting Strategy for Week 4

### Critical Alerts (Page Immediately)
- **API Availability**: <99% over 5 minutes → Critical incident
- **Error Rate Spike**: >10% 5xx errors over 2 minutes → Service degradation
- **ETL Job Failure**: Any job failure → Data pipeline issue
- **Database Unavailable**: Connection failures → Infrastructure problem

### Warning Alerts (Slack/Email)
- **API Latency**: p95 > 1 second over 10 minutes → Performance degradation
- **Cache Performance**: Hit rate < 50% over 30 minutes → Cache issues
- **Resource Utilization**: >80% memory/CPU over 15 minutes → Capacity planning
- **Database Performance**: Query time p95 > 500ms over 15 minutes → DB optimization needed

## Error Budget Management

### Monthly Error Budget Allocation
```
API Availability: 0.5% × 30 days = 3.6 hours
API Latency: 5% of requests = ~150-300 slow requests/day
ETL Success: 5% failure rate = 1-2 failures/month
```

### Burn Rate Alerting
- **2x burn rate**: Alert if consuming budget 2x faster than normal
- **5x burn rate**: Escalate to on-call engineer  
- **10x burn rate**: Consider emergency deployment freeze
- **Budget exhaustion**: Automatic deployment freeze when <10% budget remains

## Monitoring Dashboard Requirements

### Real-time SLI Status Dashboard
- Current SLO compliance percentage for each service
- Error budget remaining (time-based and percentage)
- Burn rate trends over 1h, 6h, 24h windows
- Service dependency health map

### Historical SLO Compliance
- Monthly/quarterly SLO compliance trends
- Error budget consumption patterns
- Incident correlation with SLO violations
- Performance improvement tracking

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 4: Alerting & SLO Tracking
1. Deploy Prometheus alerting rules based on established SLIs
2. Configure AlertManager for critical/warning alert routing
3. Create SLO tracking dashboard in Grafana
4. Implement error budget burn rate monitoring

### Week 5: SLO Refinement
1. Analyze first month of SLO data for baseline adjustment
2. Implement chaos engineering to validate SLO resilience
3. Optimize performance based on SLO violations
4. Document incident response procedures tied to SLO breaches

## SLI Query Examples

### Prometheus Queries for SLIs
```promql
# API Availability
(sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_code!~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100

# API Latency P95
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# ETL Success Rate
(sum(increase(etl_jobs_completed_total{status="success"}[1d])) / sum(increase(etl_jobs_completed_total[1d]))) * 100
```

### Loki Queries for Log-based SLIs
```logql
# Error Rate from Logs
sum by (status_code) (count_over_time({container_name="anime_backend"} | json | status_code=~"5.." [5m]))

# ETL Job Tracking
count_over_time({container_name="anime_etl_scheduler"} | json | event="ETL job completed" [1d])
```

## Success Metrics

By implementing these SLIs and SLOs, we establish:
- **Data-driven decision making** for performance improvements
- **Proactive alerting** before user impact occurs
- **Error budget methodology** for safe deployment practices
- **Service reliability culture** with measurable targets
- **Incident response** tied to business impact assessment

This baseline provides the foundation for maintaining and improving service reliability as the AnimeDashboard scales from development to production usage.
