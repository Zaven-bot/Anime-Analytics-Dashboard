## Docker Compose Configuration Changes
## ====================================

## WHAT I ADDED TO YOUR docker-compose.yml:

### 1. NEW SERVICE: etl-scheduler
```yaml
# ETL Scheduler Service - Automated daily data collection
etl-scheduler:
  build:
    context: ../../services/etl    # Uses same Dockerfile as your existing etl service
    dockerfile: Dockerfile         # But runs scheduler.py instead of main.py
  container_name: anime_etl_scheduler
  environment:
    # SAME ENVIRONMENT AS YOUR EXISTING ETL SERVICE
    - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://anime_user:anime_password@postgres:5432/anime_dashboard
    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0   # Added /0 for database specification  
    - JIKAN_BASE_URL=https://api.jikan.moe/v4
    - JIKAN_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1.0      # NEW: Rate limiting configuration
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy      # Waits for database to be ready
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy      # Waits for Redis to be ready
  volumes:
    - ../../services/etl:/app         # Mounts your ETL code for live updates
  command: python scheduler.py --daemon  # NEW: Runs scheduler instead of one-time ETL
  restart: unless-stopped             # NEW: Automatically restarts if crashes
  profiles:
    - scheduler                       # NEW: Optional service (use --profile scheduler)
```

### 2. ENHANCED EXISTING ETL SERVICE:
```yaml
etl:
  # ... existing configuration unchanged ...
  profiles:
    - etl  # NEW: Made ETL service optional (use --profile etl)
```

### 3. PROFILE-BASED DEPLOYMENT:
I introduced Docker Compose profiles for flexible deployment:

**STANDARD SERVICES (Always Run):**
- postgres: Your database
- redis: Your cache  
- backend: Your FastAPI server
- frontend: Your React app

**OPTIONAL SERVICES (Run with --profile):**
- etl: Manual ETL execution (your existing service)
- scheduler: Automated ETL scheduling (my new service)

## DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS I CREATED:

### Option 1: Standard Services Only
```bash
docker compose up -d
# Runs: postgres, redis, backend, frontend
# Use this for: Normal development without ETL
```

### Option 2: Standard + Manual ETL
```bash  
docker compose --profile etl up -d
# Runs: standard services + etl service
# Use this for: Manual ETL execution when needed
```

### Option 3: Standard + Automated ETL  
```bash
docker compose --profile scheduler up -d
# Runs: standard services + etl-scheduler service  
# Use this for: Production with automated daily updates
```

### Option 4: Everything (Manual + Automated)
```bash
docker compose --profile etl --profile scheduler up -d
# Runs: All services including both ETL options
# Use this for: Development with full flexibility
```

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES I CONFIGURED:

### Database Connection:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://anime_user:anime_password@postgres:5432/anime_dashboard
```
- Same as your existing services
- Connects to your postgres container
- Uses your existing database/user

### Redis Connection:  
```
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```
- Same as your existing services
- Connects to your redis container  
- Uses database 0 (default)

### API Configuration:
```
JIKAN_BASE_URL=https://api.jikan.moe/v4
JIKAN_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1.0
```
- Same API endpoint as your existing ETL
- Added rate limiting configuration
- Respects Jikan API guidelines

## CONTAINER LIFECYCLE I IMPLEMENTED:

### Health Check Dependencies:
```yaml
depends_on:
  postgres:
    condition: service_healthy
  redis:
    condition: service_healthy
```
- Scheduler waits for database/cache to be ready
- Prevents startup errors
- Ensures reliable initialization

### Restart Policy:
```yaml
restart: unless-stopped
```
- Automatically restarts if scheduler crashes
- Continues running across system reboots
- Only stops when explicitly stopped by user

### Volume Mounting:
```yaml  
volumes:
  - ../../services/etl:/app
```
- Mounts your local ETL code into container
- Allows live code updates without rebuilding
- Same pattern as your existing services

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:

### Before My Changes:
- Manual ETL: Run your b_test_jobs.py manually
- No automation: Data gets stale unless you remember to update
- Single deployment: One way to run everything

### After My Changes:  
- Automated ETL: Runs daily at 2 AM without intervention
- Fresh data: Dashboard always has latest anime information
- Flexible deployment: Choose manual, automated, or both
- Production ready: Proper error handling and restart policies

The scheduler service is essentially a containerized version of your ETL pipeline that runs on a schedule instead of on-demand!
